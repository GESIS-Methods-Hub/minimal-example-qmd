## Execution of R code

```{r}
1 + 1
```

## Dependencies

Packages that need to be installed for the reader should be listed in the `install.R` file. For example, with

```r
install.packages("jsonlite")
```

in the `install.R` file, is possible to execute

```{r}
library(jsonlite)

json <-
'[
  {"Name" : "Mario", "Age" : 32, "Occupation" : "Plumber"}, 
  {"Name" : "Peach", "Age" : 21, "Occupation" : "Princess"},
  {},
  {"Name" : "Bowser", "Occupation" : "Koopa"}
]'

json |>
    fromJSON()
```
